# AWS-Terraform
An attempt at best practice AWS configurations. This is work in progress I hope to incrimentally build on and improve.

Currently it is a cost-effective way to setup a secure VPC enviroment on AWS.

I am on the fence when it comes to tidying up and shoving all the variables in a vars.tf file, at this point it is more readable for me as is.
